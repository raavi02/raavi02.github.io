I am presently engaged in collaborative research on the topic of Large Language Model (LLM) hallucinations with <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/"><b>Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan</b></a>, in conjunction with <a href="https://www.adobe.com/in/"><b>Adobe</b></a>. Our work focused on devising methods for the identification of hallucinations, and implementing mechanisms to alert instances where LLMs produce inaccurate outcomes. We established a robust framework applicable across various tasks, minimizing the need for extensive constraints, data, and computational resources. We submitted the work to EMNLP 2024.
