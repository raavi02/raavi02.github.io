I have had the wonderful opportunity to be a Teaching Assistant (TA) for 120 + freshmen and sophomores at IIT Bombay on four distinct occasions. My experience about one of them can be found in this [blog](https://ee-damp.github.io/2022-12-21-TAship_blogs_MA111/) curated for the Electrical Engineering Department Academic Program, IITB.
