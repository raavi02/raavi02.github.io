In Fall 2024, I served as the teaching assistant for the course W4444 Programming and Problem Solving, where I developed simulators ([1](https://github.com/raavi02/Community), [2](https://github.com/raavi02/Guess-My-Hand)) and assisted [Prof. Kenneth Ross](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kar/) in running the course.
