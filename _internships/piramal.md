  <p>During the summer of '23, I had an amazing opportunity to intern at Piramal Finance. My main project was to enhance the credit risk model by accurately categorizing financial transactions from bank statements. I managed to improve the categorization by an impressive 20.4% :p. This internship ignited my passion for NLP and opened the door to many exciting projects in the future!
