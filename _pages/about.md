I am currently pursuing Computer Science as a Master's student at Columbia University. Prior to this, I was at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, where I earned my BTech in Electrical Engineering (with Honors) and a Minor in Artificial Intelligence in 2024. My academic passions revolve around machine learning, natural language processing, and optimization.

When I am not working, you'll find me chasing the thrill of adventure sports. From bungee-jumping to scuba diving, I'm always on the lookout for my next adrenaline rush! During quieter moments, I indulge in gripping murder mysteries and insightful non-fiction. If you have any book recommendations, I'd love to hear them!
