## A bit about me

I am currently pursuing MS in Computer Science at Columbia University where I am advised by [Prof. Smara Muresan](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smara/). Prior to this, I spent four wonderful years at IIT Bombay, where I majored in Electrical Engineering (with a minor in AI/ML). At IITB, I was advised by [Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/) and co-advised by [Dr. Sumit Bhatia](http://sumitbhatia.net/). I was also fortunate to work with [Prof. V. Rajbabu](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/rajbabu-velmurugan/) on unsupervised image segmentation and with [Prof. Debasish Chatterjee](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~chatterjee/master/homepage/index.html) on the construction of Lyapunov functions.

I will be graduating this December and would love to work on exciting stuff after that, do reach out if you think my profile aligns with your company goals!
