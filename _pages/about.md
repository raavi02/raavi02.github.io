I am currently pursuing Computer Science as a Master's student at Columbia University. Prior to this, I was at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, where I earned my BTech in Electrical Engineering (with Honors) and a Minor in Artificial Intelligence in 2024. My academic passions revolve around machine learning, natural language processing, and optimization.

When I'm not working, I love diving into adventure sports. Whether it's bungee-jumping or scuba diving, I'm always seeking my next adrenaline rush! In my quieter moments, I get lost in gripping murder mysteries or intriguing non-fiction books. If you have any book recommendations, I'd love to hear them!
