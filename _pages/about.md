I am currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science at Columbia University. I completed my BTech in Electrical Engineering (with Honours) with Minors in Artificial Intelligence from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay in 2024. My primary interests include areas of machine learning, natural language processing and optimization.

I love adventure sports and am always looking for the next one! In the meantime, I mostly read murder mysteries and non-fiction, but I am always looking for suggestions!
